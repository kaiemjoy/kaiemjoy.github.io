Welcome! I am an infectious disease epidemiologist with interests in measurement, diagnostics, and sero-epidemiology. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford Universityâ€™s School of Medicine. I earned my PhD in epidemiology from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), MSc in Public Health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and BSc in Global Health from Georgetown University. I currently work on evaluating serological markers do determine the incidence of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi infections as part of the Surveillance for enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) study in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
